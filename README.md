# TicTacToeClicker
An online TicTacToe cookieclicker!

As a perfect game of tic tac toe ends in a draw, the game can be made so that it gives tokens for placing an X or an O (giving extra if the player actually wins.)

With tokens, the player can upgrade the number of tokens recieved per placement, turning it into a cookie clicker (incremental) game.
Additional purchases such as an AI playing on the background for automatically recieving tokens, 'hats' - cosmetic upgrades - to the pieces/empty tiles, and a custom board, such as a 4x4, 5x5 etc. can be made.
Optionally, the player can prestige, losing all non-cosmetic upgrades, but gaining a permanent multiplier for recieved tokens.
Optionally, the player can go online to play, earning more tokens than regular play.
